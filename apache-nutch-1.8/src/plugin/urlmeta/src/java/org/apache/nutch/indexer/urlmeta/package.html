      URL Meta Tag Indexing Plugin
    </p>
    <p>
      Takes Meta Tags, injected alongside a URL (see NUTCH-655) and specified in the "urlmeta.tags" property, 
      and inserts them into the document--which is then sent to the Indexer.  If you specify these fields in
      the Nutch's schema (as well as the Indexer's), you can reasonably assume that they will be indexed.
